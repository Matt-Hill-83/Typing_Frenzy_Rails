How stuff works:

rake assets:precompile	--> precompiles assets before sending to heroku

Main Program:

- load index.html
- in index.html:
-- load all js files
-- run a script that does the following:
--- create Game
--- put create a gameView and pass in the game and the canvas context
--- start the gameView

- gameView starts a timer that runs:
-- game.step
---move objects
---check for collisions and respond
-- game.draw

Word List Pulldown:

- game asks Util.wordList() for one of the wordlists
- Game.addFish() sends this list back to utils and has it grab a single word.


In the code below, I've successfully added an event handler that ties a DOM click to a function.
My problem though, is that when I call the function, the function scope isn't in an instance of GameView, I seem to be in the scope of the GameView function.  I'm not able to access this.game.
How can I call a function from my click event that is in scoped in my GameView instance?


```(function () {
  if (typeof TypingFrenzy === "undefined") {
    window.TypingFrenzy = {};
  }

  var GameView = TypingFrenzy.GameView = function (game, ctx) {
    this.ctx = ctx;
    this.game = game;
    this.ship = this.game.addShip();
    this.timerId = null;
    this.addFishRateMs = 400000;
  };

  $('.dropdown-menu li').on("click", function() {TypingFrenzy.GameView.prototype.testFunction()})

  GameView.prototype.testFunction = function() {
    console.log(this.game);
  }```
